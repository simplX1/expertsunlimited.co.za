        <h2>PERSONAL PROFILE</h2>
        <p>
            Starting out as a field geologist, Andy migrated his skills into economic geology, mining, metallurgy and into finance. He was responsible for managing the first computerized ore reserve in the South African gold mining industry in 1986 and used Kriging and automated estimation under the guidance of Professor Danie Krige.
            Andy was a co-founder of Venmyn Rand in 1988 and has spent most of his life writing and preparing technical and valuation reports for mineral projects and oil and gas projects.
            His wide range of commodity, geological and metallurgical experience has always been set within standardized regulatory reporting processes. As such, he has been involved in most Codes of Reporting throughout the world.
            In 2000, he was introduced to the International Accounting Standards Board reporting issues for the Extractive Industries and helped forge the global mineral asset valuation codes. His practical application of these processes has led to reporting of mineral resources and reserves onto the balance sheet.
            As a result his mantra is seeking the difference between value and price which is at the centre of his operating experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            Having been involved in many disputes in the industry some of which have been litigious, Andy provides expert advice to corporate, legal, financial, accounting and technical institutions and regulators.
            He is well versed in the art of negotiations for transactors.
            His primary objective as an Expert Witness is to advise on anticipating technical and economic disputes and assessing the merits of disagreements prior to litigating. In this regard, independence and fairness are core values. He says “I won’t give evidence on matters that I don’t believe I van robustly defend in court.”
            Mr Clay is fully familiar with the CRIRSCO Codes, PRMS and COGEH, IMVAL and the valuation codes as well as applicable accounting standards related to the definition and value of mineral asset related to mining and oil and gas. Mr Clay is also familiar with many Public Reporting requirements for securities exchanges.

            <h1>Welcome to Experts Unlimited</h1>
            <p>This website is intended to provide some visibility to some of the professionals that I have come to know and trust in the minerals world that have expertise that is demonstrably important to the industry if needed. These professionals have their own marketing and sales platforms but are included here as a service to clients that I have the pleasure of working with.
                The original intention of these pages was to identify “Experts” for legal work but this has broadened to experts in general. Let’s see if it helps you.

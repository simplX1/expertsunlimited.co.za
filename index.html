            <h1>Welcome to Experts Unlimited</h1>
            <p>This website is intended to provide some visibility to some of the professionals that I have come to know and trust in the minerals world that have expertise that is demonstrably important to the industry if needed. These professionals have their own marketing and sales platforms but are included here as a service to clients that I have the pleasure of working with.
                The original intention of these pages was to identify “Experts” for legal work but this has broadened to experts in general. Let’s see if it helps you.
            </p>
            <p>Extraordinary times needs communication and help and attention – pleasant reading.</p>

            <h1>Expert Witness Principles</h1>
            <p>There is much case law about how Experts should conduct themselves and being mindful of the conflict between helping to win a case and testifying in a manner which does not demonstrate bias is a difficult task.
                Ensuring no conflicts of interest and preventing being accused of being the “Fruit of a Poisonous Tree” are crucial to maintaining the integrity of the Expert.
                However, preparing a logical, compliant and factually correct argument for each case is at the centre of credible and compelling expert witness evidence. This should be difficult to destroy and helpful to the court.
                In most cases, the courts are not familiar with technical details and trying to gain opposing experts to agree on technical facts and interpretations is a necessary but complex art.
